    /**
     * Theory :- 
     * when we toogle the theme after calculating the higest prime number of almost 7 digit 
     * the state of dark theme is change and due to this the component is re-render and when 
     * the component is re-render the highest prime number is again calculated for the for 
     * those 7 digit number even we don't need to re calculate it and the main problem is 
     * from this is that this will freeze our application or decrease the optimization like 
     * when we try to change the theme it is not immidiate change the theme it tooks some time
     * to change because some time is taken by the calcution then after the calculation is done 
     * then the theme is change so to avoid this use the hook known as UseMemo which stops the re
     * calculation and remember/memoize the value before the component re-render and take dependency that
     * when we need to change the memo value
     */


    // We can do this work by useEffect also by giving inputNumber as a dependency ****
    /**
     * Difference btw useMemo and useEffect in this situation ??
     * 
     * - When inputNumber changes, useEffect runs â†’ updates primeNumber â†’ causes a re-render.
     * - So, the component renders twice when inputNumber changes:
     *   - Once when the state updates (setInputNumber)
     *   - Again when primeNumber updates
     * 
     * - useMemo memoizes the computed value and returns it immediately.
     * - It avoids re-running the function unless inputNumber changes, but it does not trigger a re-render like useEffect does.
     * 
     * ðŸ”¹ Final Thought: Should You Use useEffect Here?
     * âœ… Yes, it's valid if you're okay with an extra render.
     * ðŸš€ useMemo is better if you want to avoid the extra render and keep things more efficient.

     * Preventing Unnecessary Re-renders of Child Components :-
     * When you pass objects or arrays as props to child components, React re-renders the child component every
     * time the parent re-rendersâ€”even if the object or array hasnâ€™t changed. useMemo can be used to ensure the 
     * same object or array reference is passed to the child, preventing unnecessary renders.
